                        balanced with a high-performance tweeter. The result is a massive, detailed soundstage that

                        M1 is the most powerful chip Apple has ever made. macOS Big Sur is an advanced desktop operating
                        system. Combined, they take iMac to entirely new levels of performance, efficiency, and
                        security. iMac wakes from sleep almost instantly, apps launch in a flash, and the whole system
                        feels fluid, smooth, and snappy. With up to 85 percent faster CPU performance and up to two
                        times faster graphics performance than standard 21.5-inch iMac models, you can use apps like
                        Xcode and Affinity Photo to compile code in a fraction of the time or edit photos in real time.
                        And it runs cool and quiet even while tackling these intense workloads. That's the power of
                        hardware, software, and silicon - all designed together.
